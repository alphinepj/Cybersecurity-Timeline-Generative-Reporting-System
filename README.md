# Cybersecurity Timeline & Generative Reporting System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Cybersecurity Timeline & Generative Reporting System** is a data-driven analytical application designed to analyse historical cybersecurity incident data and present it in a structured and visual manner. The system transforms raw incident data into meaningful insights through interactive timelines, dashboards, and automated report generation.

This project is currently developed as a **prototype** to demonstrate the feasibility of cybersecurity data analysis and reporting using modern data processing and visualisation techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* To analyse historical cybersecurity incident data
* To visualise incidents using an interactive timeline and dashboards
* To generate automated reports for summarising cybersecurity trends
* To reduce manual effort in cybersecurity reporting and analysis

---

## 🧩 Features

* Import cybersecurity incident data from **Excel, CSV, and PDF files**
* Interactive timeline for visualising incidents over time
* Basic dashboards for analysing trends and patterns
* Automated PDF report generation (prototype level)
* Modular and extensible system architecture

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The system follows a modular design consisting of the following components:

* **Data Ingestion Module** – Reads and preprocesses input data
* **Analysis Module** – Processes data and extracts trends
* **Visualisation Module** – Displays timelines and charts using dashboards
* **Reporting Module** – Generates automated PDF reports

---

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * Pandas – Data processing
  * OpenPyXL – Excel file handling
  * PDFPlumber – PDF data extraction
  * Dash – Web-based dashboard
  * Plotly – Interactive visualisations
  * ReportLab – PDF report generation

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <  https://github.com/alphinepj/Cybersecurity-Timeline-Generative-Reporting-System<img width="468" height="53" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5eb2d73c-5a35-4062-a770-2426bf193676" />
>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd cybersecurity-timeline-reporting
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open the dashboard in your browser:

   ```
   http://localhost:8050
   ```

## 🚧 Current Status

* A **prototype dashboard** has been successfully created
* Sample data can be visualised using timelines and charts
* Basic report generation is implemented

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

* Some data extracted from **PDF files is not parsed correctly**, leading to data reading errors
* LLM-generated reports are **basic and lack technical depth** at the current stage
* Certain dashboard buttons and UI components are **not fully functional**
* The system does **not support real-time data or live monitoring**

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* Improve PDF data extraction accuracy
* Enhance LLM-generated reports with greater technical detail
* Fix and complete all dashboard UI interactions
* Add real-time data integration
* Implement role-based access control
* Deploy the system using cloud infrastructure

---

## 👥 Target Users

* Cybersecurity students and researchers
* Analysts studying historical cyber incidents
* Faculty and evaluators reviewing academic projects
